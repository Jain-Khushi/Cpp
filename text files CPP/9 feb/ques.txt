Define a class named Triangle as follows:
a. Data members are firstSide, secondSide, and thirdSide.
b. Use a constructor that asserts that the sum of any two sides to be greater than
the third one.
c. Accessor member functions are getSides,getPerimeter, and getArea. To find
the perimeter and area of a triangle, use the following.
perimeter = a + b + c
area = sqrt ((p) ∗ (p - a) ∗ (p - b) ∗ (p - c)) // p = perimeter / 2
d. Define a constructor for the class.
