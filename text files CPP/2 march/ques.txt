1) Write a menu-driven program to perform the following operations on C++ strings:
a) Compare 2 strings taken from the user
b) Concatenate 2 strings
c) Convert all lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase.
d) Calculate the number of vowels
e) Reverse the string


2) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a duration of time in the form
hours, minutes, and seconds. The program then calculates the duration in
seconds. The program must throw three different exceptions objects: HExcept
(if hours is negative), MExcept (if minutes are not between 0 and 59), and
SExcept (if seconds are not between 0 and 59). Create three exceptional classes
that inherit from the OutOfRange parent exception class. Use polymorphism
(catch-by-reference) and one catch clause to handle all cases.
